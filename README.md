# MazeSurvival
200 IQ Pac-Man. See how many moves you can survive against the colored dots!  
## Maze Generation  
The maze is generated using the Growing Tree algorithm, which is explained [here](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/27/maze-generation-growing-tree-algorithm).  
The procedure for choosing the next cell is 75% newest, 20% middle, 5% random.  
## AI  
The AI for the dots are based off of Pac-Man ghosts. The algorithms for pathing are explained [here](https://gameinternals.com/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior).
